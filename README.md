## Translation

Translating localization files can become increasingly complex, especially as your project expands. [**Localizely**](https://localizely.com/) simplifies the translation process, tracks progress, and seamlessly integrates localization into your workflow. It offers a variety of integrations, including [GitHub](https://localizely.com/github-integration/), [GitLab](https://localizely.com/gitlab-integration/), [Bitbucket](https://localizely.com/bitbucket-integration/), and [Figma](https://localizely.com/figma-integration/), along with powerful features such as [Reports and Statistics](https://localizely.com/reports-and-statistics/), [Machine Translation](https://localizely.com/machine-translation/), [Translation Memory](https://localizely.com/translation-memory/), and a [Glossary](https://localizely.com/project-glossary/).

To simplify the translation process, navigate to [Localizely](https://app.localizely.com/register) and create a new project. Afterwards, update the `localizely.yml` file with the missing data (e.g., project_id) and integrate localization into your workflow in a manner that best suits your needs, whether that's by using the [Localizely CLI](https://localizely.com/cli/) tool or any of the available integrations.
